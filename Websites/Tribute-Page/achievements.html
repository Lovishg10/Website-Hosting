									<h4>Igniting the personal computer revolution.</h4>
									<p>With the Apple II and the Macintosh, Jobs and the then-named Apple Computer (AAPL) helped to launch the PC revolution. The Apple II, released in 1977, was one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. The Macintosh, introduced in 1984, was the first commercially successful PC to use a mouse and graphical user interface.</p></li>

									<h4>
										Introducing the mouse and graphical user interface.
									</h4>
									<p>
										If you’re an inveterate geek, you almost certainly know the provenance of the window-based, graphical user interface: PARC labs, the research wing of Xerox, a company that tried dearly to break out of its photocopying and printing roots, but never quite succeeded. Prior to the PARC GUI, computers were command-line, keyboard-driven beasts that only the beardiest of hackers could operate.

										Xerox lacked the gumption to do anything with the GUI, however. It produced the Alto computer in 1973, but it was never sold commercially. This is some eight years before the (mostly-command-line) IBM PC was released, don’t forget. Then, in the late ’70s, and sitting on an ever-growing treasure trove of new tech (Ethernet, bitmap graphics, GUI, WYSIWYG), Xerox finally caved and decided to link up with Apple, a young up-start that was enjoying huge success with the Apple II. The hope was that Apple would be able to succeed with PARC’s inventions where Xerox had not.

										Suffice it to say, Apple succeeded — but not immediately, and not as a direct result of its collaboration with PARC. In the winter of 1979, Apple’s executives — including Steve Jobs — took a tour of PARC. Jobs was in the process of designing and building Lisa, his first computer, and at the time it only had a command-line interface — and then he saw the mouse-and-GUI at PARC. Ironically enough, the Lisa was a huge commercial failure when it launched in 1983 — and the Macintosh that followed in 1984, Jobs’ next project, was only a marginal success. The seeds had been sown, though, and in 1985 Microsoft released Windows 1.01 — and as we all know, the rest is history.
