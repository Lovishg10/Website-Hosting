# Home-Delivery-Website
This is a responsive website for a food delivery company which doesnot exist and the site actually has dummy text and I made this website with the help of CodeWithHaryy tutorial.
This is hosting on <a href = "https://lovish-garg.github.io/Home-Delivery-Website/">this</a> link.
